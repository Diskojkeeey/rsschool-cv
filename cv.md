## About me
In my youth, I loved figuring out what a computer was made of and how it worked. As an adult, I realized that my whole life would depend on computer technology. But when the time came to choose my future profession, I chose law school. This decision had a negative impact on my life. And I decided to change it. To strive for knowledge that will really interest me. That I would enjoy and have fun with. So, now, I put my interests first and use my personal time to study FrontEnd development to get a taste of life.


I hope I will overcome myself. Break myself and mold myself alive. Build myself a beacon of hope and follow towards it.
